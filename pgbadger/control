Description: Fast PostgreSQL log analysis report
 pgBadger is a PostgreSQL log analyzer built for speed with fully detailed
 reports from your PostgreSQL log file. It's a single and small Perl script
 that outperforms any other PostgreSQL log analyzer. It is written in pure Perl
 and uses a JavaScript library to draw graphs that are zoomable and can be
 saved as PNG images.
 .
 pgBadger is able to autodetect the log file format (syslog, stderr or csvlog).
 It is designed to parse huge log files as well as compressed files.
